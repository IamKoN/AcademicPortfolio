 I have always enjoyed many disciplines: math, writing, design, science, art. The challenge of problem solving and the process of creating something beautiful were both satisfying. When I realized as a software developer that I could be both author and architect, artist and engineer, I knew I had found my calling.
 
 Using technology and programming to improve the lives around me is my passion. My goal as a professional is use my skills to build a world that continues to value equality, peace, and truth.
