Intellectual property is a distinct, self-contained creation owned by single entity. This creation could be art, music, film, literary work, formula, invention, a process, code, or many more things. The entity could be person or group that are the original creators or current owners of the property rights.

There are many types of intellectual property rights, each one appropriate for a specific type of creation and situation in which that creation is being used. For example, books, music, and movies are often protected by a copyright, established by the Copyright Act of 1976. A copyright is a specific type of property right that grants exclusive ownership, reproduction, and distribution powers to the creators. Another type of property right is patents. Patents were setup by the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act. Patents are typically suitable for inventions. Software patents are often used as industry standards. The last property right that will be discussed is trade secrets. Trade secrets are typically information about private formulas, recipes, processes, best-practices, designs, patterns or systems that allow a company to be competitive in their given market. Unlike copyright and patent protected material, trade secrets must remain secret to be valuable. Once publicly disclosed or stolen, trade secrets offer no competitive edge.

It is critical that IT companies understand the nuances of intellectual property. Software could be protected under any of these intellectual property rights. The ambiguity of intellectual property poses two main concerns. The first is defining what strategy should be used to protect one’s own property. The second is ensuring the company is not misusing anyone else’s intellectual property. Some businesses have protected valuable code using intellectual property rights. Others have chosen to freely offer their computer software code so that other software engineers can use, modify, and learn from the computer software code. “These competing ideologies make it difficult for software engineers to know whether, and to what extent, it is permissible to copy computer software code. Software engineers have an inherent ethical duty to respect the work product and intellectual property rights of others” (Sarah J. Duda)

The battle over the fair use of protected material characterizes both sides of this issue. The Fair Use Doctrine asserts that any copying of copyrighted material done for limited and transformative purpose is acceptable. It allows anyone to comment on, criticize, parody copyright material. Fair Use provides an economic benefit to many high-tech businesses. In 2007 the Computer and Communications Industry Association representing Google, Microsoft, Oracle, Yahoo! and other companies, released a World Intellectual Property Organization study that found that “fair use exceptions to US copyright laws were responsible for more than $4.5 trillion in annual revenue for the United States economy representing one-sixth of the total US GDP and 18% economic growth” (Association). As the United States economy becomes increasingly knowledge-based, the ability to use content in a limited and unlicensed manner is becoming a cornerstone of our economy in the digital age.
