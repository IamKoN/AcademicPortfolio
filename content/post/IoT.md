The Internet of Things(IoT) is a network of hardware sensor systems designed to directly interface with humans. IoT devices generally communicate with one another via the internet to create a system meant to improve quality of life. For example, a smart house may have wake-up timers connected to sleep monitors, the coffee maker, and the central heating. All these devices can work together to make the home-owner’s morning more efficient and enjoyable.

Now imagine that this smart home has vulnerabilities to external attacks. Suddenly the owner is in danger of major privacy violations and physical harm. The internet of things has massive potential to improve the efficiency of homes, building, transportation, and entire cities. This potential also translates to the risk involved. The IoT field is growing rapidly. Companies are adapting to make room for IoT in their business models. As part of this expansion and integration process, any CTO should weigh the impact of cyber security and virtual networks.

Cyber security is the backbone of IoT. If the communication among smart devices is in anyway unsecure, the danger of the network overshadows the benefits. Applications in IoT offer many benefits but also many risks. “Poor design, unplanned interconnections, and human adversaries raise the stakes…for system designers. Early identification, mitigation, and prevention of these threats can help limit liability issues” (Jeffrey Voas).

These systems gather large amounts of data with their monitoring capabilities. Therefore, tools and methods to mitigate diverse trust challenges are required before such systems can safely manage daily life. Privacy is paramount. “Possibly the most serious of these issues surrounds cyber-physical systems that control life-critical applications. Liability matters quickly manifest because of the potential for unplanned interactions between critical and noncritical things” (Jeffrey Voas). Thus, businesses should deploy vetted IT infrastructures to ensure tech interoperability without exposing the whole system if there is one point of failure. Firewalls can inhibit viruses, worms, or trojan horses. Encrypting data passed among devices can shield it from spyware. With such great societal impact, it is imperative that IoT-based systems are trustworthy, secure, and reliable.

Some IoT companies are primarily invested in virtual networks. They can be educational, or social, like Facebook, or entertainment, like WoW, an online role-playing game. These networks can exist in virtual reality or augmented reality, e.g. PokemonGo. They all use IoT to simulate some desired experience. Like real networks, they are vulnerable to bad actions. The hosts of these networks have a responsibility to discourage cybercrime, whether it is bullying, stalking, spreading false information, illegal transactions, predators, scamming, etc.

Thankfully legislation like the Communications Decency Act and Children’s Internet Protection Act help parents defend their children from dangerous content. Remember that “the most important element of an Internet of Things is people, and people are not just things. Unscrupulous collection of such information could lead to social problems of inequality, bias and discrimination” (Sahil Sholla). However, if we design these systems with people and their security at the forefront, they will improve everyone’s quality of life.
