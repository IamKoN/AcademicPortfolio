Ethics are standards or codes of behavior expected of an individual by a group to which the individual belongs. The ethics of the creation, distribution, and use of software and information is struggling to keep pace with developing technology. Every stakeholder in the IT industry must understand the ways in which ethics is vital to the industry’s continued safety, privacy, consistency, and integrity.

There are many ethical approaches to consider in any given information technology situation: virtue ethics approach, utilitarian approach, fairness approach, common good approach. It is a good practice to choose one or multiple ethical frameworks for a given situation. They can serve as a foundation upon which a company can begin an ethical decision-making process.

IT businesses face an ever-growing list ethical challenges unique to their trade. As a software professional, the chief issues are handling contingency workers, green computing standards, and information integrity.

Some employers abuse the use of temporary workers by neglecting them in every significant way other than pay. Contractors demand long hours, exclude temps from corporate culture, deny them equal benefits, and rarely invest any valuable training into these workers. “The basic working and employment conditions of temporary agency workers shall be at least those that would apply if they had been recruited directly by that undertaking to occupy the same job” (Eckhard Voss). Contingency workers may be a cost-efficient solution in the short-term, but the cost of re-hiring and re-training people is more expensive in the long run. There is a risk in hiring people who have no loyalty or commitment. Companies must consider the cost of liability if these workers are hurt, disrespected, or intend to commit corporate espionage. The health of the industry rests partially on companies’ responsibility to cultivate experienced professionals.

Businesses have a responsibility to be ecological. “Emission of CO2 due to ICT products is increasing rapidly which is damaging our environment” (Rushan Arshad). Green Computing is the efficient use of computers and related technology by humans in an ecofriendly manner. This can be accomplished by reducing carbon footprints and electronic waste and enabling low-impact lifestyles. Devices should be designed, manufactured, used, and disposed of with efficiency in mind. As the use of computers increases so do carbon dioxide emissions. “Through more environmentally aware usage, such as effective power management and shut-down during periods of inactivity, and by adopting current lower power technologies, computers can already be made significantly more energy efficient” (Singh). These steps will foster sustainable tech.

The ethical implications of information integrity are massive. Any business that collects, stores, or uses private information is responsible for that data during its lifecycle in their systems. As a software professional I take information ethics seriously. According to Floridi’s Macro Information Ethics, “ICT with all informational structures and processes generates our new informational habitat. Moral action is an information processing pattern” (Dodig-Crnkovic). ICT companies must use IE to protect against misrepresentation, resume inflation, internal or external bribery, conflict of interest, breach of contract.
