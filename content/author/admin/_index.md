We all have a responsibility to leave a legacy behind us that is better than the one that was left before us. Using technology and programming to improve the lives around me is my passion.

I have always enjoyed many disciplines: math, writing, design, science, art. The challenge of problem solving and the process of creating something beautiful were both satisfying, so I struggled to figure out which profession was for me. When I realized as a software developer that I could be both author and architect, artist and engineer, I knew I had found my future. My goal as a professional is use my software skills to build a better world, a world that values equality, peace, and truth.

I have implemented an AWS software system capable of streaming clinical data and lab results through a machine learning model that can diagnose patients with sepsis and predict the probability of developing sepsis, all in real-time and at scale. This research project is not just academics, it can save lives, and that what is exciting about software development.

My work should benefit others and there is no reason to wait to make that happen. I have little interest in work that does not accomplish this. If you or your company have a similar approach to the work you do, I would love to talk to you.
