In the context of the software development industry, freedom is the flexibility to create any software product by any means. The code is the only law. This creative license drives the high-efficiency advancement of the new technologies. The space is always evolving, competing, and improving. Unfortunately, in some environments this volatility can be a hinderance, or even a danger.

There is a special kind of conflict between the freedom of creation and the need for regulation. Regulation is essential to ensure safety, security, and consistency among software products. While creative freedom is desired, failure to meet regulatory standards can result in a liability claim, a whistle-blower, or even in a safety-critical system flaw.

The regulation of the software development process is a space which affects the way my team and me function every day. Professionals want to develop and design using the techniques that work best for them. The most widely adopted software systems development processes include spiral, waterfall, and agile or scrum. These processes allow independent developers work together to design, implement, test, and ship high quality solutions. This freedom and collaboration enable efficient development, but what happens when the reigns are too loose? The company may be face strict liability claims, negligence claims, breach of warranty claims, or misrepresentation claims. These liability claims between a software company and their client can cost millions.

The company may also be subject to internal accountability. When an internal member of an organization suspects there is sloppy or unethical work being done, they can use the whistle-blowing process. Whistle-blowing is dangerous and should be done carefully: assess the seriousness of the situation, address concerns internally, escalate concerns internally, consider public disclosure, develop an action plan, execute the plan and live with the consequences.

To avoid getting into such conflicts, regulatory compliance is mandatory. HITECH, the 2009 Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, is a good example of the benefits of proper regulation (Howard Burde). The act required government standards for the national electronic health records (EHR). Doctors and hospitals were incentivized with Medicare reimbursements to use EHR to exchange patient healthcare data. This saved the government funding through improvements in the quality of care and the protection of identifiable health information. HITECH regulations improved healthcare quality and IT productivity by reducing costs.

Regulation can foster greater productivity, collaboration, and quality. A software team can benefit from “regulatory skills, such as time management, efficient use of resources, and task distribution” (Maryi Arciniegas-Mendez). Unfortunately, many developers do not effectively regulate their activities. Regulated learning encourages collaboration processes through strategic control. Implementations of this concept include the Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice and the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition Code of Conduct. These shared standards enable software professionals to create better social, economic, and environmental outcomes for stakeholders in the information, computing, and electronics supply chain. These outcomes include improved health and safety conditions for laborers, increased efficiency for customers and suppliers, economic development, and a cleaner environment for communities.
