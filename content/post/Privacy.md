Privacy is the right to be left alone, “the right most valued by a free people.” From the perspective of the Natural Law ethical theory, privacy is a core condition of freedom; when a person’s privacy is taken away, so is their freedom. Working for a company that is a leader in information privacy is one of my top priorities.

There are many different ideas about what privacy is and how to best to protect it. Seclusion theory suggests privacy is one’s right to secrecy, anonymity, and solitude. Control theory says that one has privacy if and only if one has control over information about oneself. Restricted access theory indicates privacy amounts to restricting access to information about oneself. All these theories have at least one thing in common: privacy is something valuable that must be fought for.

Any business that handles sensitive information should be familiar with the struggle for that info’s security. In the United States we are a free people, and we understand that if we do not defend that freedom, we will lose it. Successful IT companies should prioritize the safety of their stakeholders’ information and and understand the legal and ethical boundaries of advanced surveillance technology.

Most collected data it not very useful to the collector and not very dangerous to the owner. Unfortunately, the valuable data can be very hazardous if used against the owner. In the case of a data breach, information like health records, financial data, children’s data, or location data could be leaked to the wrong people. A company’s stakeholders would be susceptible to blackmail, stolen identity or property, fraud, or having their information sold to the highest bidder. With such violations of trust, there is an intrinsic loss of freedom. IT executives need to change their approach to privacy. Value-based design and stakeholder management are a good start but “the amount of time allowed for system development is too short and autonomy is too limited for many engineers to live up to their ethical responsibility. Over 60% of a sample of 124 engineers described themselves as being responsible for privacy. However, over a third reported that they work for an organization with weak privacy and security norms and non-supportive corporate management”  (Spiekermann). Therefore, businesses need to embrace privacy system engineering as well.

A recent privacy issue is the regulation of advanced surveillance technology. Software professional must be familiar with the legal and ethical boundaries of drones, electronic discovery, and consumer profiling. Drones are a good example of this necessity. As the use of drones continues to proliferate in commercial and recreational markets the appropriate regulations to protect personal privacy is critical. Drones represent an opportunity for new business processes and services that should not be stifled. “However, that innovation will be undermined if drones are operated in an untrustworthy manner”  (Stephanie Winkler). Only regulations with consequences for intrusions into personal space can drive trusted behavior in this fast-moving environment.
